# Instagram 7-Day Warm-Up SOP

## Purpose
Warm up a brand-new Instagram account, especially when logging in on a new device and IP, over 7 days. The objective is to establish normal user behavior signals and reduce the risk of Instagram flagging the account.

This SOP is designed to be readable by both humans and LLMs.
